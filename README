This is the Java Json 2.0 Library. It's main usage is to automatically serialize
java classes to syntatically correct Json.

The two main ways of using it are:

1. Have a class implement the Jsonable Interface
This signals the framework that it is ok to take the public variables of this class
and create a json object of the form:

variable_name : variable_value.

Keep in mind that the ACTUAL variable name is the variable name that comes out
in the Json. So if I had a class named:

Object o = new Object() {
       public String myName = "Michael";
       protected String myProtectedName = "Samuel";
       private String myPrivateName = "Gottesman";
};

The resultant would be:
JSON.toJSON(o) => {"myName":"Michael"};

2. Annotate a non-JsonableObject's method with the @TOJSON annotation. This tells the framework
that that method is a getter method whose result is to be serialized to JSON.

Two main things here to notice:
	a. The getter method must have no arguements
	b. The name of the resulting json field will be the method's name
		lower cased with the first three letters dropped (get does
		not look good in variable names =p)

NOTE JSONABLE OBJECTS w/@TOJSON METHODS WILL RESULT IN ERRORS. DO THAT AT YOUR OWN RISK.

I hope that this is of use to you as much as it has been to me.
