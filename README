This is the Java Json 2.0 Library. It's main usage is to automatically serialize
java classes to syntatically correct Json.

Its main usage is to annotate Java Objects Methods with the @TOJSON annotation.
This tells the framework when you run the object through the method JSON.toJSON
that this method's output should be serialized to JSON.

Some notes:

1. byte[]/Byte[]/char[]/Char[] are automatically serialized to Strings. All other
primitive arrays are serialized to a [1,2,3,4...] form.

2. All method names will have the first 3 letters removed and be decamelcased.
See #3 for information about the former. With regards to the latter, this
means that:

BigFatString

would become:

big_fat_string

Or in english, all capital letters except for the first character of the string
(if it is capitalized) are replaced by a _ and its respective lower case
version. If the first character is capitalized, it is just downcased.

3. @TOJSON(prefixLength = ?, contentLength = ?, fieldName = ?)

There are three properties of @TOJSON that you can use to control the
field names of your json objects. By default it is assumed that you will
annotate getter methods with @TOJSON. In java the getter naming convention
is:

getThisObject()

So java-json would then take this method's name and serialize it to:

"this_object":RETURN_VALUE

where RETURN_VALUE is whatever the return value of getThisObject is. Lets say
you want to serialize a boolean query like:

isObjectBig()

If you leave it as is, it will be converted by java-json to:

bject_big

That is no good. so instead of marking isObjectBig() with just @TOJSON, you
mark it instead @TOJSON(prefixLength = 2). This instructs java-json to
only remove the first 2 characters of the method name instead of the first 3.
Then you will get:

"object_big":BOOLEAN

which is what you want. Lets say you have a very complicated method name like:

isValueAString();

Here you only want a substring of the method name. How would you specify that?
Obviously you can't just use @TOJSON(prefixLength = ?) or @TOJSON because you
would get something ugly. Instead you combine prefixLength and contentLength,
to get a substring of the method name. This looks like:

@TOJSON(prefixLength = ?, contentLength = ?)

or in this specific case:

@TOJSON(prefixLength = 2, contentLength = 5)

which would then take the substring of the method name at indexes 2 and 7,
resulting in the field name:

"value":STRING

Of course is this is not good enough for you (demanding customers ; p), you
can just name the field to whatever you want by annotating the method with
@TOJSON(fieldName = "STRING"). Whatever is the decamelcased value of String, will be the
value of the field, no matter the method name. So if I went

@TOJSON(fieldName = "FrogsLionsBears)
getMyBigString() { ...

The output would be:

"frogs_lions_bears":STRING
